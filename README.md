# DEV-BOT

Hey hackers 👋🏻,I have made a really cool discord bot 🤖!! His name is DEV-BOT ! 🎉🎉

ReplIt: [ReplIt](https://replit.com/@shreyazz/DEV-BOT#index.js)
## What does this bot do 🤖? 

This bot sends the latest blog you posted on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) and it also helps people search the top 3 blogs for a specific topic.

The commands of the bot are as follows:

- `-devprof user-name` this will show the latest blog you have published.
- `-devtag any-tag` any-tag can contain, tags for example: JavaScript/TypeScript/Python.
  - Do keep in mind the tags should not have spaces.
  - Ideal command is -> `-devtag javascript`.
  - Head on to [tags-website](https://dev-tags-website.shreyazz.repl.co/) to see some of the tags on dev.to .
  - Not all the tags are mentioned on the website, so try your luck... if the tag is not available or incorrect the bot will let you know.
- `-devhelp` to see the help message from the dev-bot.

## What Language / Frameworks / Libraries / Tools did we use 💻 ?

We have used :

- Express JS -> To host the bot on ReplIt.
- Discord.JS -> To code the discord bot.
- DOT-ENV -> To hide secrets (BOT's Token).
- Node-Fetch -> To fetch the DEV.to  API.
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) -> To monitor if the bot is up or down.

## What problems we ran into ⛔?

The main problem we ran into was of maintaining the quality of code.

Now what do I mean by the quality of the code?

The way you write the code and the way you use best practices or the way you design you folder structure gives a bonus point, and for people who will look at the code or someone willing to contribute to the code will not get confused.

The code should not be clustered and messed up and clarity should be maintained.

## What did we learn during this project  🔮?

Now let's dive into the main thing!! Which is "What did we lean from this project"?

We learnt:

- Discord.JS
  - We learnt how to send embed messages in discord.
- Async / Await
  - In this project we had to make quite a few async functions and that helped us a lot to grasp the concept of the same.
- Importing / Exporting Node Modules
  - We have made a different local module for each feature in an individual file and exported it into the main code.
- Maintaining the Code Quality
  - In this project we have tried to maintain the best code quality.
  - We have used some best practices for this project. 

  

## Improvements and Updates 💎!

In the next update of the bot, we are planning to add a web crawler which will crawl on Dev.to and search amazing blogs for you.

Now you might think that the tag features already exists, but this feature will let you allow to search a whole topic for eg :

`-devsearch javascript array methods`, this command will bring top-3 articles for the searched topic.
